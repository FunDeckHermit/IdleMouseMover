# IdleMouseMover
AutoHotkey V2 script that moves the mouse after a certain inactivity of mouse or keyboard. 

### Usecases
This tool can be used:
  * To prevent the system going to sleep
  * As a means to show activity in MS Teams / Slack or other corperate tools

### Usage
1. Download the .exe from the sidebar under "Releases"
2. Run on startup or define a Windows Task to run on boot

### Security
Downloading a dodgy .exe from GitHub isn't best practise. You can also download the .ahk file and compile the exe yourself.
